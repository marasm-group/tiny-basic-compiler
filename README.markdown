Tiny BASIC Compiler
===================

Introduction
------------

A simple [Tiny BASIC][tinybasic] compiler that targets marASM machines.

Usage
-----

The compiler can be built with Java 8 and [Apache Maven][maven]. The following
command will build it and run the unit tests:

    mvn compile test

You also need [mvm](https://github.com/marasm-group/mvm) and [mvm-console device](https://github.com/marasm-group/mvm-console), which are used for assembling the
output of the compiler and linking it with the standard C library.

Example programs can be found in the `examples` folder. They can be compiled and
executed like so:

    $ cat examples/squares.tb
    10 LET X = 1
    20 PRINT X * X
    30 LET X = X + 1
    40 IF X > 10 THEN END
    50 GOTO 20
    $ ./tinybasic ./examples/squares.tb ./examples/squares.marasm
    $ mvm ./examples/squares.marasm
